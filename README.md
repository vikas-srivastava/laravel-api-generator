# Intro

A set of shell scripts and Laravel commands designed to automatically generate APIs on a fresh Laravel installation, based on a custom configuration file. This config file, which is structured from the system design documentâ€™s actors and use cases, allows developers to specify module and class names. The goal of these scripts is to significantly reduce setup time when starting new projects, streamlining the bootstrapping process for developers.

# How to use this Repo
